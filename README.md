# stock-market-api

## Background & Objectives
In this exercise, we are going to play around with the stock market API [iexcloud.io](https://iexcloud.io/).

The goal here is to get comfortable reading API documentation.

## Data

The endpoints of the API we want to use are protected **behind a paywall**.

As Le Wagon, we kindly provide you with a **proxy** to that API for you to use _only during the challenge today_. We trust you!

## Tools

For this exercise we will work with a Python Jupyter Notebook using libraries as numpy, pandas and  matplotlib.
